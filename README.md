## Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

### About this project
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using personal and lifestyle attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The main goal was to understand which factors influence healthcare costs the most and build a machine learning model that can estimate insurance charges accurately.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

### Dataset
The dataset includes 1338 records with both numerical and categorical features like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The target variable is insurance charges, representing the medical cost for each individual.

---

### What I worked on
-Explored the dataset to understand distributions and relationships between features
-Created visualizations to identify patterns influencing insurance costs
-Detected and handled outliers using the IQR method
-Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features
-Built and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models
-Evaluated model performance using R², MAE, and MSE

---

### Key insights
- Smoking status, BMI, and age were the strongest predictors of insurance costs
- Insurance charges showed a right-skewed distribution
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in prediction accuracy
- Lifestyle and health metrics significantly impact insurance premiums
